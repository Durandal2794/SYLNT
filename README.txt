This folder contains a Jupyter notebook (code, comments, and output displayed inline) and a Python file (code + comments) to answer the question in the prompt given to me on this past Monday (8/14/2017).

The notebook can be viewed here at this link if you don’t have Jupyter installed:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Durandal2794/SYLNT/blob/master/SYLNT.ipynb

The SYLNT.py file can be run from the command line via:

python <path_to_SYLNT.py> <path_to_DS_test_merchant.csv>

It will print some status text to the screen; when it’s done it will print the answers to the 2 questions.

NOTE:  The program takes ~ 20 minutes to run, so best to let it sit for a bit.  Ironically (and I discovered this after the exercise was complete), the problem could have been 90% correctly solved in ~10 minutes of work + ~1 minute of execution time using a simple regex filter.  Who knew…
